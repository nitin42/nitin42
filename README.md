### Hi, I'm Nitin Tulswani 👋

I am a web developer currently working at [Bulb Energy](https://bulb.co.uk/) based in London.

You can get in touch with me on Twitter [@NTulswani](https://twitter.com/NTulswani) where I mostly share things about my work, or through [email](mailto:tulswani19@gmail.com).

I am not so active these days as I used to be working on the open source projects but the pinned projects below are some of my favourite 🤩 

#### Other things

I enjoy working on creative coding projects. These are some of things that I have created in the generative art world -

* [Elements Of Physics](https://elements-of-physics.surge.sh/) 🚀 - Learn about different elements of physics using an interactive simulator.

* [React Color Tools](https://react-color-tools.surge.sh/) 🖍️ - A set of tools as React components for working with colors.

* [React handy renderer](https://github.com/nitin42/react-handy-renderer) ✍️ - A custom React renderer to draw 2D primitives in sketchy style. 

* [Generative design](http://generative-design.surge.sh/) 🌟 - A collection of interactive sketches created using Processing.

* [Shaping functions](https://shaping-functions.surge.sh/) 🌊 - A visualisation of different shaping functions used in shaders.
